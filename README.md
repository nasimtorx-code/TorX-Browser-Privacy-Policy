Privacy Policy for TorX Browser

Last Updated: February 8, 2026

1. Introduction
Welcome to TorX Browser. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our browser and its integrated SOCKS5 Proxy services.

2. Core Features and Services
Our app provides a fast and private browsing experience. It includes an integrated SOCKS5 Proxy that can protect traffic both inside and outside the app, functioning as a system-wide VPN using the Android VpnService API. We also provide a curated news section for our users.

3. Data Collection and Usage
We follow a strict no-logs policy. We do not track, collect, or store your browsing history, the destination of your traffic, or any data content. No personal information like your name or email is required to use the core features of the app. The VPN/Proxy service is used solely to tunnel your traffic securely; we do not inspect or intercept your data.

4. Advertising Policy
To keep our service free, we use a very minimal advertising model. The current version of TorX Browser is completely ad-free. In future updates, we plan to show only one advertisement when a user starts the VPN service. No ads will be shown when turning off the service or during the browsing session. We are committed to showing a maximum of three ads per day per user.

5. Third-Party Services
While we do not collect data, we may use third-party tools for news feeds or app stability. These services have their own independent privacy policies.

6. Permissions
We only ask for necessary permissions. Internet access is required for browsing and proxy connections. VPN permission is required to provide system-wide protection for your device.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We recommend you review this page periodically for any changes.
